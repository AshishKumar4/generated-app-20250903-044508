# Template Selection Guidelines

This template provides a minimal but powerful setup to kickstart a modern React single-page application (SPA).

- Use this template when you need:
    * Client side heavy projects with lightweight or minimal backend
    * Static applications 
    * Dashboards with mostly client side code
    * Simple, fast projects that are suitable for Vite

- Do not use it for
    * Static marketing sites
    * Landing pages focused on SEO or server-rendered content
    * Projects that require SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
    * Projects that require a lot of backend or server-side stuff

- Built with
    * React Router 6 for declarative client-side routing
    * ShadCN UI (v2.3.0) for customizable and accessible UI components built on Radix UI primitives
    * Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
    * Lucide Icons (React) for modern and lightweight iconography
    * ESLint with sensible defaults and TypeScript support
    * Vite for ultra-fast local development and builds
